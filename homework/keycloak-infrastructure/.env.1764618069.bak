# Keycloak Infrastructure Environment Variables
# 
# VAULT INTEGRATION: Keycloak container fetches most secrets from Vault using AppRole
# Only essential variables remain in .env file

# Vault AppRole Credentials
# These credentials allow Keycloak to authenticate with Vault and fetch secrets
# Generated from: scripts/setup-vault-approle.sh
VAULT_ROLE_ID=2d430979-2470-8696-d1c7-9fe47ab47286
VAULT_SECRET_ID=b3c1d0fd-c7a7-64d6-9d98-7c0852458967

# Database Password (for PostgreSQL container only)
# Keycloak fetches its DB credentials from Vault, but the postgres container
# needs this variable directly since it doesn't support Vault integration
KEYCLOAK_DB_PASSWORD=qGrEGpQCfqchXoy31mNNeoRysa7iA3PU

# Note: Admin credentials (KEYCLOAK_ADMIN, KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD) 
# are fetched from Vault by the Keycloak entrypoint script
